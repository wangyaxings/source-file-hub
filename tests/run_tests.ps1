# Test Summary

**Date:** $currentTime
**Package:** $Package
**Verbose:** $Verbose
**Coverage:** $Coverage
**Race Detection:** $Race
**Timeout:** $Timeout

## Test Results

All tests passed successfully! ðŸŽ‰

## Coverage

"@

        $summary += @"

Coverage report generated: $OutputDir/coverage.html
Coverage summary: $OutputDir/coverage.txt

"@
    }
    
    $summary += @"

## Next Steps

1. Review the coverage report to identify areas for improvement
2. Add more tests for uncovered code paths
3. Consider adding integration tests for complex workflows
4. Monitor test performance and optimize slow tests

## Test Structure

- **Unit Tests:** tests/auth/, tests/database/, tests/handler/, tests/middleware/, tests/server/, tests/apikey/, tests/authz/, tests/logger/
- **Integration Tests:** tests/integration/
- **Test Helpers:** tests/helpers/

## Best Practices

- Keep tests focused and atomic
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Clean up test data after each test
